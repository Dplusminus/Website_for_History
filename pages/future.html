			While nobody can predict the future of videogames, there are a couple of paths that many people think that
			the video game industry will lead down. As we have seen there is a new growth in games that involve the player
			having much more physical interactivity than in the past. One example in the forwarding of this technology 
			is the Oculus Rift. The Oculus Rift is a headset that has been pushing itself into the eyes of future gamers.
			The jist of the Oculus is that you put on a headset and you can move your head around to move the camera, making
			controlling a videogame character all the more intuitive and fun. <br />
			Another example of what future videogames might be like is the simplicity of the Wii. While the Wii may not be 
			as popular as the Xbox or the PS3, it started something revolutionary when it started motion gaming. From them, 
			the PS3 has started the Playstation Move and Microsoft has started using the Kinect, both of which are used to
			find the players movements and use them to play the game. These have become very popular for various dancing games
			as well as few first person shooters.
