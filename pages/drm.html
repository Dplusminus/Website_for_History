			Many gamers are in an upset recently over the news reguarding the new Microsoft System, The Xbox One. The new Xbox
			is causing quite a lot of controversy in both that people think that it is beginning to pry into their entertainment
			system a little too much, as well as that they are making it impossible to use games that are not new. All games
			will have to be bought online or at a retailer and installed on the hard drive. Locking the game to your Xbox Live 
			account. The main reason for them doing this is to try to put a stop to the illegal use of games and, more importantly
			for them, make themselves more money. Another aspect of this travesty is that you cannot trade games privatly anymore,
			making it a huge pain to get a new game, even if your brother, who has a different Live account, has it. There is a 
			slight PC equivelant to this madness, that is actually very popular, called <a href="store.steampowered.com">Steam. </a>
			Steam was created by Valve, the company that brought you Portal and Half-Life, to make PC gaming seem more woven together
			and overall better. In my personal opinion it works wonderfully, but only because Steam isn't your full computer, you 
			do have an option to not use Steam and still get all of the same games that you would otherwise.
