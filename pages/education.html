			Learning math while flying, learning reading while racing, educational games based on fun with different activities 
			attempt to engage the student with fun so that they forget that they are learning, but still retain the knowledge.
			Leapster Company is one of the leaders in handheld games. More and more research suggests video games as exceptional 
			training and educational tool, at home and in the classroom. Research based-well designed video games help improve reading,
			math, and critical thinking. Traditional learning games are drill and practise, not engaging or fun like MMO games. no
			depth equals no interest. Collaborate with others for a purpose, compelled to focus and learn through failed attempts, 
			absorbing information and developing strategy each time they navigate the level or game.  Also, the actions they take 
			directly affects other players.

			Educators argue that good video games teach and develop skills, from writing and physics to problem solving.
			“World of Warcraft” based language arts curriculum created, “Angry Birds” for physics, etc.
			“WoW” curriculum based on being required to study riddle poetry, share notes with their guild, write their own riddle poems
			, critique each other, then share their work.
			“Minecraft” has students research National Monuments and build them to scale. A fourth-grader built a model of the Cape Hat
			teras lighthouse, showing his problem solving in learning to keep the creatures away, and the development of his thinking.
			“Angry Birds” used to teach physics and math, based on catapulting objects using a parabola without air resistance for the 
			bird’s trajectory.
			“Atlantis Remixed:The Doctor’s Cure” teaches students to write persuasive essays, which are then read over and critiqued 
			by a character played by the teacher. The students revise their work and continue through the game, encountering problem 
			solving situations and puzzles and after every big adventure, writing a new essay which incorporates the new information 
			they have learned.
			“Mystery of the Tagia River” students explore the qualities of water to discover why the fish are dying out. They 
			experiment with turbidity and temperature, nearby businesses and logging, and in the end they must write an essay which
			explains what they believe is killing the fish and how the problem can be solved.<br />
			“Sim City” teaches basic computer controls, but also teaches the player how cities are planned, built, and run.
			Typing games help students learn about the computer keyboard, preferable to just being told or shown.
